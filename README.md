Contains code used for capturing screen frames, as well as feeding keyboard input, so that I can train a neuralnetwork on games


This project currently uses a super mario implementation found in here: https://github.com/justinmeister/Mario-Level-1 
Some slight modifications was made to the super mario code, just so I can get some states from the game. Aside from that the author of the super mario code has written all the code for the game.
